Data Structues 
Data Structues is a combination of two words data and structues which means arrangin data in
a computer.
There are two types of data structues.
1. Linear data structues.
2. Non Linear data structues.

1. Linear data structues
            Linear data structues allows data to be arranged in sequential manner.
            Every elements has neighbours-left and right.
            They have predefined extreames
            example => Arrays, Linked List, Stack, Queues.
            Arrays => Stores data in contiguous memory
                      Access elements randomly
                      Stores Homogeneous elements
                      Applications:
                           Suitable for applications that requires freequently searchings.
                           Storing information.(In Linear Way)
                      
                      1D Array
                           1D array can be related to a row
                           Elements are stored one after another
                           Only one subscript or index is used.
                      2D Array
                           2D Array related to table or metrix
                           Elements are stored one after another i.e 1D inside other
                           Two subscripts or indexes used i.e one for row and other for column
                           Dimentions depends on the number of subsciption or indexes

            Linked List => It dose not require any conguous memory so we can insert or delet elements
            Stack => last in first out.
            Queue => first in first out.

2. Non Linear data structues
            Non Linear data structues allows data to arranged in non sequential manner.
            There can not be 'n' neighbours of a single element.
            They don't have predefined extremes.
            example => Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Graph, AVL Trees, Red Black Trees e.t.c
